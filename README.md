## Logseq Plugin Automatic URL title

#### :warning: This is my personal fork of this plugin, feel free to use it but I don't guarantee anything. :)

Automatically fetches the title of a website and wraps it into markdown link format. Also, renders the favicon of the url next to it.

![demo](demo.gif)

To disable the favicon, override the `--favicons` variable.

```css
:root {
  --favicons: none;
}
```
